### üé® 6. Design & UX Considerations

* **UI Philosophy:** The user interface must be clean, minimal, and highly intuitive.
* **Focus on Video:** The primary screen will be dedicated to video feeds.
* **Controls:** In-call controls should be overlaid and set to auto-hide to avoid obstructing the view.
* **User Flow:** The journey from opening the app to starting or joining a call must be swift and require minimal steps.
